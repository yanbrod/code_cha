We value your time, and while you are free to spend as much time on the challenge as you wish, we expect it to be completable _within three hours_. This challenge is not-timed, and we will consider your solution independent of however long it took to complete. If you need more than 5 days in total to complete the code challenge, please let us know so that we can plan accordingly.",
